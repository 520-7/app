- Ozel Yilmazel: Backend server, post routes, user routes, mongodb integration, recommendation algorithm, upload post functionality, bug patches, backend API tests.
  - Backend is used to efficiently communicate with mongodb and abstracts details for the frontend. It handles many types of functionality to support a social media. Frontend uses these routes all throughout the application. Recommendation algorithm is used by the frontend feed-screen to show appropriate posts to users. Upload post screen allows users to select images and audio from device's own storage. Fixed bugs throughout the app. Wrote the testing suite for the application, testing suite tests each route with high coverage. Used Node.js and express, and jest for testing. Frontend used react-native and paper components library.

- Ryan Zaid: Search screen, profile screen, edit profile screen, following screen, frontend server requests, minor backend bug fixes.
  - Search screen allows users to look up accounts and accounts with a genre. Profile/edit screen allows users to change their details later on. Has developed frontend by connecting it to backend, all data is passed from frontend. Worked in some bug fixes. Used react-native and paper.

- Hanna Jiang: Profile screen, sign up screen, post screen, feed screen, frontend server requests, minor bug fixes, basic server tests.
  - Different creens allow the user to interaect with the app and see their social network. UI elements from React Native and paper, and connected backend API calls to the frontend for a seamless user experience. The feed page uses the recommendation algorithm and posts held in the Mongo database, and the signup integrates with the baceknd to hold new profiles, as well as encrypts passwords. Bug fixes, usually for type errors.

- Aryan Nair: Sign up screen, login screen, onboarding screen, feed screen, frontend server requests, UI fixes, logo design, integrated feed screen w/ other screens.
 - Created onboarding and feed page with React Native and paper to provide fluid user experience. Frontend server requests to retrieve other user data and authenticate user. Feed page is the main page, so tried variations of it (Instagram, Spotify like posts) until decided on the final design that fit with the project.

- Rachel Lahav: Genre search, login/signup screen, minor bug fixes, quality testing
  - Genre search allow users to search up 5 random accounts who share the genre of interest. Login and signup essential to onboarding, done in React Native and paper. Quality checks in code for formatting and commenting code.
