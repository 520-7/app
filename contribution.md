- Ozel Yilmazel: Backend server, post routes, user routes, mongodb integration, recommendation algorithm, upload post functionality, bug patches, backend API tests.
  - Backend is used to efficiently communicate with mongodb and abstracts details for the frontend. It handles many types of functionality to support a social media. Frontend uses these routes all throughout the application. Recommendation algorithm is used by the frontend feed-screen to show appropriate posts to users. Upload post screen allows users to select images and audio from device's own storage. Fixed bugs throughout the app. Wrote the testing suite for the application, testing suite tests each route with high coverage. Used Node.js and express, and jest for testing. Frontend used react-native and paper components library.
